# SAE2024_Final

### Plans for implementation - needed components

#### Sampler Engine üéõÔ∏è

- Process parameter and MIDI Events and render the audio
- Allocate voices attached to a file or manage the number of active voices (voice stealing)
- Load or configure sound banks, such as SFZ, sf2, aiff...

#### ADSR Module üìâ (Attack Decay Sustain Release)

- Shapes the volume of the signal over time through an envelope generator or another trigger. See code reference of `adsr.c` from [7].

#### Sampler Voice üéπ

- An object which holds a reference to a sample mapped to a keyboard and defines basic properties of said sample (i.e. root note, length, loop point, start point, etc.)

#### Audio Buffer üóÑÔ∏è

- A low level data structure which can stream a sample from disc and load it into memory

### High level audio graph:

**MIDI Device in DAW** -> **Sampler Voice (audio buffer)** -> **Sampler Engine** -> **ADSR Module** -> **Output Audio Buffer**

### Platform of choice: VST Plugin [https://github.com/RustAudio/vst3-sys/](https://github.com/RustAudio/vst3-sys/)

### Main Goal: Add SFZ support to existing sampler in VST wrapper: [https://github.com/sinshu/rustysynth/tree/main/rustysynth](https://github.com/sinshu/rustysynth/tree/main/rustysynth)

### functionality from user point of view and how it differentiates from similar products

The digital sampler software should be able to have the following funtionality:

- Load and play samples from a sound bank.
- Pitch shifting property when connected to a external controller.
- Sample editing features such as playback/loops.

Some special features to be futher explored:

- Real time sampling (i.e. the ability to record a sample through the sampler then play it back as opposed to loading a file from the disk)
- Filter options for samples

#### Bonus
While the main focus of our project will be a VST implementation purely in Rust, we recognize there are other plugin formats, such as [AUv3](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/audiotoolbox/audio_unit_v3_plug-ins), which are not language agnostic.
Thus, we will link some resources here for exploring those formats for future developers who are interested. However, we will not implement these wrappers as it is outside the scope of this project.
