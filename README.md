# SAE2024_Final


## Next Steps

* After installing Rust, you can compile Ase Example as follows:

* cargo xtask bundle RustSampler --release

* In the initialize method, somewhere around line 240 change the file directory of your samples, otherwise it will panic. 


* [ ] Voice sampler fix/debug (maybe have another)
  * Preset loading:
    * If opened without any preset, it should load the default one
    * [ ] <s>Preset metadata loading feature?</s>
  * Sustain loop: Sustain the note when key is held down
    * [ ] Ways to keep sustain, loop back and forward? Start from the beginning of the loop?
  * ADSR:
    * [ ] Implement the ADSR GUI
    * [ ] ADSR filter
  * Real Time Sampling:
    * Load multiple files without interrption
    * [ ] Implement the GUI
    * [ ] Support drag and drop
  * Keyboard mapping
    * [ ] UI object for keyboard
    * [ ] Handle multiple voices (stacking/by selection)

### Plans for implementation - needed components

#### Sampler Engine 🎛️

* Process parameter and MIDI Events and render the audio
* Allocate voices attached to a file or manage the number of active voices (voice stealing)
* Load or configure sound banks, such as SFZ, sf2, aiff...

#### ADSR Module 📉 (Attack Decay Sustain Release)

* Shapes the volume of the signal over time through an envelope generator or another trigger. See code reference of `adsr.c` from [7].

#### Sampler Voice 🎹

* An object which holds a reference to a sample mapped to a keyboard and defines basic properties of said sample (i.e. root note, length, loop point, start point, etc.)

#### Audio Buffer 🗄️

* A low level data structure which can stream a sample from disc and load it into memory

### functionality from user point of view and how it differentiates from similar products

The digital sampler software should be able to have the following funtionality:

* Load and play samples from a sound bank.
* Pitch shifting property when connected to a external controller.
* Sample editing features such as playback/loops.

Some special features to be futher explored:

* Real time sampling
* Filter options for samples
